  <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

  <p>This game is designed to help you discover matching cards while remembering their location. It is a great way to connect with your friends as well as to improve your memory.</p>
